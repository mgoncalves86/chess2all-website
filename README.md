## About the Project

Chess2All is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting chess as an educational and inclusive activity. This one-page website serves as the organization's online presence, providing information about their mission, activities, partners, and contact details.

## What is Chess2All

Chess2All is grounded in the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic of 1976, Article 79, reinforced by Article 1 of Law No. 30/2004, of July 21 – Basic Law of Sport – which recognizes sports as indispensable for personal development and societal progress.

The realization that chess could reach areas other sports cannot and its positive impact as a tool for innovation and social responsibility led to the creation of Chess2All. On March 8, 2023, International Women's Day, the first step towards establishing the Chess2All Association was taken. Chess2All is a non-profit association with a focus on inclusive, innovative, and social sports, headquartered in the municipality of Matosinhos, Portugal.

The key figures behind Chess2All are three women who fully contribute to the cause: Susana Gonçalves, Jussara Chaves, and Tânia Chéu.

- **Susana Gonçalves**: President of Chess2All, FIDE member on the Women's Chess Commission (WOM), FIDE chess trainer, chess instructor for children and adults in underprivileged contexts, and FIDE chess arbiter.
